Some Helm charts created by me.

A simple chart that deploys Kubernetes' [Guestbook application]([link](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateless-application/guestbook/)) with Redis database. It also includes life cycle hooks to back up and restore the Redis database

A simple chart that deploys a file sharing application. It is using Nextcloud image for frontend and bitnami/postgresql as a database.
